# AirportClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## A web client for Airline Dispatcher using Angular

For the previously written API (Airport), you need to create a client using Angular.
For each entity, two List and Detail components must be created. List - shows a list of all objects of the entity, Detail - shows detailed information for one object.

- [ ] The application must be able to interact with the CRUD operations that you implemented earlier

- [x] To navigate and access components, make a menu on the UI and use routing to use the services to make requests to the server (use Observable.) Promise can not be used.

- [x] You must use at least two modules. For example, render services or something shared in another module (Common, Shared, whatever) and connect it to the main one.

- [x] The output must be formatted (eg angular pipes)

- [x] UI-framework can be used any (for example Boostrap, Angular Material, SemanticUI). Appearance will also be evaluated (based on the previous lecture on HTML / CSS).
